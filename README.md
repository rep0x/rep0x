# 👋 Hello world
Nice to meet you friend. My name is Sven (rep0x) and I am a self-thought generalist working at anynines.com as a Full Stack Designer, Frontend Developer and Team Leader. Besides that I have several side projects I am working on - for the most part open source projects. I am passionate about the interrelation of people, nature, design and code.

## 🚀 Projects

## 💎 Skills

### 🎨 Design
One of my beloved disciplines is Design from strategic Design Thinking and general Design Principles that we all find in our daily life if we pay attention over Branding and Print Design up to User Interface and User Experience Design. I am a big fan of the Atomic Design principles and the Branded Interaction Design (BIxD) process. This is what I am pretty good with:

- Figma
- Adobe Creative Cloud
  - Adobe XD
  - Adobe Illustrator
  - Adobe InDesign
  - Adobe Photoshop
- Sketch

### 📱 Frontend
Originally I started Frontend Development because I thought my designs for developers are too bad. Not in a sense they would not have been beautiful, but in the sense that it was very hard to implement the designs I have been doing. So I decided to learn it to improve my design preparation for developers - turns out I fucking love coding. I also learned that Clean Code and Developer Experience is something I am naturally really good with because of my Design background, leading to a great synergy. This is what I am pretty good with:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- ESLint & Prettier
- React
- Svelte
- Vue
-
