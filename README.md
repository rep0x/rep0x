# 👋 Hello world
Nice to meet you friend. My name is Sven (rep0x) and I am a self-thought generalist working at anynines.com as a Full Stack Designer, Frontend Developer and Team Leader. Besides that I have several side projects I am working on - for the most part open source projects. I am passionate about the interrelation of people, nature, design and code.

## 🚀 Projects

## 💎 Skills

### 🎨 Design
One of my beloved disciplines is Design from strategic Design Thinking and general Design Principles that we all find in our daily life if we pay attention over Branding and Print Design up to User Interface and User Experience Design. I am a big fan of the Atomic Design principles and the Branded Interaction Design (BIxD) process. This is what I am pretty good with:

- Figma
- Adobe Creative Cloud
  - Adobe XD
  - Adobe Illustrator
  - Adobe InDesign
  - Adobe Photoshop
- Sketch

### 📱 Frontend
Originally I started Frontend Development because I thought my designs for developers are too bad. Not in a sense they would not have been beautiful, but in the sense that it was very hard to implement the designs I have been doing. So I decided to learn it to improve my design preparation for developers - turns out I fucking love coding. I also learned that Clean Code and Developer Experience is something I am naturally really good with because of my Design background, leading to a great synergy. This is what I am pretty good with:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- ESLint & Prettier
- React > Vue > Svelte
- Design Systems
- Storybook
- Material UI
- Bootstrap
- Webflow

Next up: Test Driven Development and Web3

### 🎯 Management
My career actually started as being an entierly unexperienced CEO of a startup I founded with a couple of friends of mine. I have struggled with my studies, since I am simply unable to learn things that I am not passionate about or I don't believe make sense to learn. After one year being speaker at the General Students Committee and another year of being president at the student parliament, I knew that responsibility is pushing my motivation to unknown heights. So I founded and we grew for almost 5 years. From 5 people to more than a dozen. From small projects for private people to projects with huge corporates. I love people and theres nothing more fulfilling for me than to lay the ground for people to unfold their potential and say true to themselves. This is what I am best with:

- Atlassian Suite: Jira, Confluence, Jira Service Managment
- Slack
- Google Suite
- Hiring & Interviews
- Agile Management 
- Establish bottom up processes
- Finding the right Mission, Goals and Values
- Turn bad habits into good ones - one by one
- Automating processes with the above tools
- Administrating above tools
